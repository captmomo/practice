> Full podcast will be released soon, here is a teaser clip with Lyle discussing the beloved ECA stack. Would be interested to hear people's experiences with it. I generally stay away from stimulants but I can recognize the efficacy of its use. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOe1G7DSCfc&feature=youtu.be&fbclid=IwAR1DvdRlQ_rx4wm06NrSDUoB4K5vyfCWU1QnSWb0qOorEtdOc6FGvpFXwWw 
* Ethan Painter: Looking forward to it 
* Joshua Ford: I stay away too, but can see how it would benefit people. Looking forward to the podcast. 
* Nicholas Alonzo: Ive been using it sense I was 17. I am now 23. I used to only use it for when I was dieting down but I found that it helps me to keep the fat off after dieting as long as I continue using it so ive been using the full dose 3X daily for over a year straight now. Although I will say I am the type of person that likes stimulants. 
  * Dave Maconi: Nicholas Alonzo Damn man, thatâ€™s the first time Iâ€™ve heard of someone going to that extreme with it.Howâ€™s BP, HR, and sleep quality? 
  * Nicholas Alonzo: Dave Maconi All my vitals are normal and I can get to sleep as long as I have at least 4 hours from my last dose. Although my stim tolerance is naturally high and I have tried stronger stuff before but at the same time I would imagine that if you use something every day your body gets used to it and normalizes. 
* Jer Chapman: I have used it extensively and to great effect. 
  * Jer Chapman: (in terms of managing hunger mostly) 
  * Jordan Mann: (And feeling generally invincible) 
* Marco Maunero: I don't know if it's legit mine or not, but I feel really bad after taking it. Don't have any problems with clen, high doses coffeine and the other stim that you snort. 
* Pat O'Reilly: Is Lyle referencing Thiamine? Couldn't quite get the word.. 
  * Dave Maconi: Pat O'Reilly https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine 
  * Pat O'Reilly: Dave Maconi thank you 
* J.D. Haltigan: Enjoyed this clip. 
  * Dave Maconi: J.D. Haltigan Thanks for watching ðŸ™‚ 
  * J.D. Haltigan: Have read all the lit + Lyle's books. Great stuff. Tried&true the ECA stack. I think the aspirin may be underrated... 
  * Dave Maconi: J.D. Haltigan elaborate on your thoughts on why aspirin is underrated 
  * J.D. Haltigan: Thins the blood (blood flow imp) and is adjuvant to focal ephedrine + caffeine. Esp. with continued training seems to me to really ease friction related agitation (e.g., epicondylitis/IT band syndrome) that chronic training often promotes, thus enabling perhaps more output over time or rather less steep drop in force/intensity of training as calories cut. Maybe it's placebo for me. Just my 2c. 
* Jessica Fuller: I've used 25mg E x 400mg C for 3 doses throughout the day on and off through the years with much success. I have yet to pair it with A. It helps me mostly with appetite suppression and is decent for energy. 
  * Dave Maconi: Jessica Fuller Damn 1200mg caffeine per day huh...this group doesnâ€™t mess around 
  * Jessica Fuller: Dave Maconi That's the high end, usually for RFL or VLCD. When the deficit isn't as extreme I do 200mg per dose and sometimes only 2x per day, but I should mention I am stim tolerant (ADD). 
  * Dave Maconi: Jessica Fuller So is this protocol (3 x [25 + 200-400]) on top of your ADD stims? 
  * Lyle McDonald: I remember when Haycock was recommending up to 6 doses per day of EC, every couple of hours. That was awesome and I managed to rewrite at least 2 timelines during that part of my life. 
  * Dave Maconi: Lyle McDonald damn so 150mg E and 1200mg C per day? Iâ€™m over here with my 1 cup of coffee on workout days ðŸ˜… 
  * Lyle McDonald: 120 mg E but yeah. Ah, youth. Now caffeine after 4pm and I can't sleep 
  * Ryan Edwards: What about bronkaid dosing since E is banned 
  * Lyle McDonald: Funfact: Bronkaid is ephedrine. 
  * Ryan Edwards: Right, but at what dosage should it be taken to be effective, 1 pill with caffeine? 
  * Lyle McDonald: Is 20 mg unclear? 
* James Magnuson: EC sure has been great for damage control during Covid. I'd have put on a lot more fat if it wasn't for the appetite suppression that EC gives me. 
* Anthony Preda: Iâ€™m not sure if Lyle has written about this on the site or in any of the *books*, but on the topic of stimulants, out of curiosity:What are the effects of ADHD prescription medication (Adderall, Vyvanse, etc.) on metabolic rate and how do they comparâ€¦See more 
  * Liana Valentino: Anthony Preda Iâ€™m wondering this same thing as Iâ€™ve never taken it worried about it messing with the adderall I take Lyle McDonald 
  * Lyle McDonald: I refuse to believe that there is not a single study on adderall/amphetamine and metabolic rate in humans. And yet I can't find anything. Just rat studies and one on appetite in humans.I know it blunts appetite. I would imagine it increases metaboâ€¦See more 
  * Lyle McDonald: Oh I'm sure part of it is appetite. But now I want to know what the metabolic effects are. One reddit thread commenter said it was only 50-100 calories but no source was given and I can't find a damn thing on the topic in humans. 
  * Anthony Preda: Thanks for following up on this because I did try searching on this on pubmed awhile ago, and I pretty much gave up on it since I couldnâ€™t find anything. It just came to mind again seeing this post about EC.Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s also a matter of itâ€™s effectiveness over time. 
  * DK Stone: Anthony I take vyvanse and adderall for ADHD and I also take EC 2x daily. I find the prescribed stims to be calming with no increase in my HR. EC makes me sweat a little more and when Iâ€™m walking around, if I take my bp then at the higher range of normal. 
  * DK Stone: Also, interestingly I have found that synephrine hcl does a better job for me as a thermogenic.. even better than bronkaid.. (Neosyneohrine or Prep H) 
  * Lyle McDonald: Synephrine is a vasoconstrictor You feel warmer but you're not generating more heat. 
* Stephanie Jarrett: I love it! Completely put a halt to my compulsive eating. I can't binge when I am on this . I take breaks from it when I don't need it , but it has completely removed the ability to binge like I used to . I love it. 
  * Dave Maconi: Stephanie Jarrett Thatâ€™s great ðŸ™‚ when you say you canâ€™t binge you mean youâ€™d be too full if you tried while taking it? 
  * Stephanie Jarrett: Dave Maconi I mean I can't stuff it in, I feel full right away . I struggled with binge eating since I started training diets in 1994. That became emotional eating that lasted for over 20 years, with food as my first thought when I get upset or overtired, While I may reach for food for comfort still, I am definitely not hungry and if I eat something it isn't an ass out binge. What happened in this process, is that I began to clearly identify the triggers and I will take a stack to help me curb or avoid the binge. I only take it 1x a day sometimes or twice , then can go days without it. 
  * Sara Austin Brooks: Stephanie Jarrett (or anyone)is there a place online you can order bronkaid? 
  * Stephanie Jarrett: Sara Austin Brooks I get mine at Walgreens, Walmart has it too, and I am Mi , Meijers has it 
  * Sumi Singh: Sara Austin Brooks afaik it's not avail online but behind the counter at pharmacy (you have to show your drivers License) 
* Stephanie Jarrett: Been a Lyle-odile since 2009 and in the PSMF was where I first learned about stacking, I don't use aspirin .I was scared of it for many years, but I found the right dosage. 
* Martin Julien: I've been using 24mg ephedrine and 300mg caffeine as a pre workout for the past 15 years (y) 
* Carrie Huett: I have both anxiety and intermittent afib but if i thought i could get away with it id be all over that stack. I may experiment one day, but for now even the yohimbine gives me uncomfortable (benign) pac/pvcs. 
* Traci St Claire Johnson: I love Bronkaid but It will screw up your stomach if youâ€™re not careful. 
  * Christy Sullenberger: Do you take it with aspirin? I got some really impressive stomach pain when I tried ephedrine with aspirin. That was years ago, never tried it since, was greatly relieved to read the A was nonessential. 
  * Christy Sullenberger: Actually, to add, I don't know the variable affecting it, but I have found bronkaid to be comparatively harder on the stomach than primatene tabs. I wonder if it's a sulfate vs. hcl difference. Like the bronkaid has a larger effect*, ime, so I'll take â€¦See more 
  * Traci St Claire Johnson: Christy Sullenberger way back in the 90s I did but for a short time. I just picked it back up last year taking it alone with coffee and started having stomach pain. Stopped and it went away. There is one study on a guy that had to have part of his stomâ€¦See more 
  * Christy Sullenberger: Traci St Claire Johnson I just looked that up - stomach damage was never on my radar re: ephedrine. Is this the case you're referring to? https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2988902/ Have you seen any other cases of it in your reading? Gosh, Iâ€¦See more 
  * Traci St Claire Johnson: Christy Sullenberger yeah thatâ€™s one lol! 
* Ahmad Hamad: All my ephedrine sources got shut down unfortunately. 
* Jenna Tolson: Unfortunately, the appetite reducing effects are all but gone, even after several months of a break :( Was glorious while it lasted though! Tyrosine doesn't seem to help all that much either. Just screwed. 
  * Nicholas Alonzo: Jenna Tolson add 4mg nicotine lozenges to the stack. Right after you take your dose pop a lozenge in your mouth it works. 
  * Jenna Tolson: Nicholas Alonzo interesting. Would that be more, um, habit forming tho?? ðŸ™„ðŸ™„ 
  * Nicholas Alonzo: Jenna Tolson No because the rate of nicotine delivery is too slow in nicotine replacement products to have an addiction potential. 
  * Jenna Tolson: Nicholas Alonzo Thanks. good to know! 
  * Nicholas Alonzo: Jenna Tolson https://bodyrecomposition.com/.../fat-loss-supplements...Here is where lyle mentions it 
* J.D. Haltigan: Is there a way to print out a post and its full threaded replies? Want to digest this one more....
